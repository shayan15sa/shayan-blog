Hello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically I&rsquo;m wrong but anyways).
The other day, I was just trying doom Emacs and fell in love with it (I have been using neovim for 2 years now) specially the org-mode feature which is way better than any other task management system that i have used since i started using them (near 3 years). I&rsquo;ll probably write about this in another post. As you can probably guess from the header, I have finally found a way that I can share my thoughts easily. Writing, yes. You know, I love YouTube and I believe that it&rsquo;s the superior platform, but The thing is that whenever I tried to make YouTube video, I&rsquo;ll just write very long script read of off it. Which brings me to this conclusion,"><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/posts/starting-anew-series/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/shayan-blog/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/posts/starting-anew-series/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/posts/starting-anew-series/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shayan's Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Starting A New Series"><meta property="og:description" content="Writing is fun Hello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically I’m wrong but anyways).

And if haven’t guessed it yet, the new series is about me journaling everyday (or at least I’ll try to make it daily). And by journaling I mean write a little bit about my thoughts that I have everyday (I mean writing about fleeting notes that I take everyday, shout out to my zettelkasten friends).\nSee you tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow This post was more of an introduction than an actual post of series. I believe it would fun to read what other people think about. And writing, to me, is something that can calm me down for some moments.
