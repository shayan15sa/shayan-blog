[{"content":"Writing is fun Hello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically I\u0026rsquo;m wrong but anyways). The other day, I was just trying doom Emacs and fell in love with it (I have been using neovim for 2 years now) specially the org-mode feature which is way better than any other task management system that i have used since i started using them (near 3 years). I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write about this in another post. As you can probably guess from the header, I have finally found a way that I can share my thoughts easily. Writing, yes. You know, I love YouTube and I believe that it\u0026rsquo;s the superior platform, but The thing is that whenever I tried to make YouTube video, I\u0026rsquo;ll just write very long script read of off it. Which brings me to this conclusion,\nI like writing and I should do it, and only writing.\nJournaling, a way to force my self to write As a person who has seen many people journal and write a diary everyday, I always wonder: \u0026ldquo;But Why? Why would you spend a good amount of time everyday to write to stuff that has happened to yourself?\u0026rdquo; I still agree with some part of that, but I look at the \u0026ldquo;journal thing\u0026rdquo; quite differently now. And if haven\u0026rsquo;t guessed it yet, the new series is about me journaling everyday (or at least I\u0026rsquo;ll try to make it daily). And by journaling I mean write a little bit about my thoughts that I have everyday (I mean writing about fleeting notes that I take everyday, shout out to my zettelkasten friends).\nSee you tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow This post was more of an introduction than an actual post of series. I believe it would fun to read what other people think about. And writing, to me, is something that can calm me down for some moments. Thanks for reading Have a great day !\n","permalink":"https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/posts/starting-anew-series/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"writing-is-fun\"\u003eWriting is fun\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically I\u0026rsquo;m wrong but anyways).\nThe other day, I was just trying doom Emacs and fell in love with it (I have been using neovim for 2 years now) specially the org-mode feature which is way better than any other task management system that i have used since i started using them (near 3 years).

Imagine you pay someone hour by hour for watching your windows if you see him talking to the phone for half an hour right in middle of washing what do you do? that\u0026rsquo;s easy you just fire him or you tell him not to do that right? It is the exact same deal for the school. you are paying the teachers to drink tea.\nTime is Priceless In Farsi we say \u0026ldquo;Time is gold\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s obvious that it means the time is really valuable right? so if that teacher is late around 5 minutes for each of his/her classes and he has just one class a day and he teaches in 7 different classes. In The US there are 180 school days so 180 * 5 = 900 min which is 15 hours. if assume that everyone of his classes has 20 students. in total he would have 140 student and every year there is going to be 15 * 140 = 2100 hours of people\u0026rsquo;s lives would be wasted that is equal to 87.5 days 2.91 MOUNTH.\nSchool hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed for so long You know, can you say something which is completly perfect? I can\u0026rsquo;t. the reason is (at least in my opinion) there\u0026rsquo;s nothing called perfect. look what are you gonna compare this pizza to in order to say this is the perfect pizza or not. This question has been around for so long for example if you think about it even just for a minute you find lot\u0026rsquo;s of way to actually improve schools, from making changes to rules to chanting and adding new subject So why haven\u0026rsquo;t been any major changes. maybe because it\u0026rsquo;s better for them this way.\n","permalink":"https://shayan15sa.github.io/shayan-blog/posts/why-nothing-is-fair-in-school/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehey, have you ever you think why if student arrived late would get punished but teachers not.\nlook at least in most of the schools in Iran, WE ARE paying a lot of money to the schools so, why are we not paying attention to it or are we ok with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"main\"\u003eMain\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"we-are-paying-money\"\u003eWE ARE PAYING MONEY\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyes that\u0026rsquo;s our money which is wasted every single second that teachers are late so we\u0026rsquo;d better fight for our rights.\nImagine you pay someone hour by hour for watching your windows if you see him talking to the phone for half an hour right in middle of washing what do you do?\nthat\u0026rsquo;s easy you just fire him or you tell him not to do that right?\nIt is the exact same deal for the school. you are paying the teachers to drink tea.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why Nothing Is Fair in School"}]
