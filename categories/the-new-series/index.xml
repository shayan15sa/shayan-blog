&lt;p>Hello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically I&amp;rsquo;m wrong but anyways).
The other day, I was just trying doom Emacs and fell in love with it (I have been using neovim for 2 years now) specially the org-mode feature which is way better than any other task management system that i have used since i started using them (near 3 years). I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write about this in another post. As you can probably guess from the header, I have finally found a way that I can share my thoughts easily. Writing, yes. You know, I love YouTube and I believe that it&amp;rsquo;s the superior platform, but The thing is that whenever I tried to make YouTube video, I&amp;rsquo;ll just write very long script read of off it. Which brings me to this conclusion,&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
