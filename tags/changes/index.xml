&lt;p>hey, have you ever you think why if student arrived late would get punished but teachers not.
look at least in most of the schools in Iran, WE ARE paying a lot of money to the schools so, why are we not paying attention to it or are we ok with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="main">Main&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="we-are-paying-money">WE ARE PAYING MONEY&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>yes that&amp;rsquo;s our money which is wasted every single second that teachers are late so we&amp;rsquo;d better fight for our rights.
Imagine you pay someone hour by hour for watching your windows if you see him talking to the phone for half an hour right in middle of washing what do you do?
that&amp;rsquo;s easy you just fire him or you tell him not to do that right?
It is the exact same deal for the school. you are paying the teachers to drink tea.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
