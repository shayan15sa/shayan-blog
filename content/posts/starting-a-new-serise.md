# Writing is fun
Hello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically i'm wrong but anyways).
The other day, I was just trying doom emacs and fell in love with it (I have been using neovim for 2 years now) specially the org-mode feature which is way better than any other task managment system that i have used since i started using them (near 3 years). I probably write about this in an other post.
