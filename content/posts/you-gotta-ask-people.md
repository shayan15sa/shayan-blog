As Steve Jobs said you ask people for help or anything 
He says that in experience people don't usually refuse your request.
But you know let's imagine there's a 1/1000 chance of someone answering you email. That means if you email 1000 people you gotta get  at least one answer and that's a pretty good reason for me to start emailing people and containg people that I like.
