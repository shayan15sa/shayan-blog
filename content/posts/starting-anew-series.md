# Writing is fun
Hello everyone, Welcome to my first blog post (technically I'm wrong but anyways).
The other day, I was just trying doom Emacs and fell in love with it (I have been using neovim for 2 years now) specially the org-mode feature which is way better than any other task management system that i have used since i started using them (near 3 years). I'll probably write about this in another post. As you can probably guess from the header, I have finally found a way that I can share my thoughts easily. Writing, yes. You know, I love YouTube and I believe that it's the superior platform, but The thing is that whenever I tried to make YouTube video, I'll just write very long script read of off it. Which brings me to this conclusion,
> _I like writing and I should do it, and only writing._
# Journaling, a way to force my self to write
As a person who has seen many people journal and write a diary everyday, I always wonder: _"But Why? Why would you spend a good amount of time everyday to write to stuff that has happened to yourself?"_ I still agree with some part of that, but I look at the _"journal thing"_ quite differently now. And if haven't guessed it yet, the new series is about me journaling everyday (or at least I'll try to make it daily). And by journaling I mean write a little bit about my thoughts that I have everyday (I mean writing about fleeting notes that I take everyday, shout out to my zettelkasten friends).
# See you tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow 
This post was more of an introduction than an actual post of series. I believe it would fun to read what other people think about. And writing, to me, is something that can calm me down for some moments. 
Thanks for reading
Have a great day !
